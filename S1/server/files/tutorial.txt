000008 Tutorial for Server/Client Communication Program
000009  - This program is designed to send simple text files across a network from a server to client(s).
000010  - The protocol followed is a modified version of the Stop and Wait protocol discussed in lecture. Thus the server will send the data in individual frames, broken in frames of 64 bytes, and wait for a response from the client.
000011    - A data structure was created to store data for the frames. The struct has the following data members:
000012      - seq (string): the sequence number of the frame being sent. Simple is a simple simplex protocol, this value will either be 0 or 1
000013      - parity (string): the parity bit for the data of the frame. In order to test that the protocol properly deals with corrupted data, every 5th frame will have an incorrect parity bit.
000014      - type (string): the type of the frame. Either ack (acknowledgement of a correct frame), nak (negative acknowledgement of an incorrect frame), or dat (data frame sent containing information from the text file)
000015      - line (string): the line number that the data frame corresponds to in the file. Line numbers are 5 digits long, meaning this protocol can only handle files less than 100,000 lines. A file larger than this would be hundreds of Gigabytes, thus it was deemed suitable.
000016      - data (string): 64 bytes of data taken from the file.
000017    - The Socket programming inherited from the course tutorial only passes strings across the network, thus functions were written to convert frame structs to string (frame_to_string) and to assemble a frame struct from a string (assemble_frame)
000018  - This program operates in two different scenarios:
000019    - Scenario 1: One client requesting the data from the server
000020      - In this scenario, there is only one client and one server
000021    - Scenario 2: One server and up to five clients
000022      - In this scenario, the server will use multithreading to handle requests from up to five clients
000023  - Instructions:
000024    1: Open the directory with the scenario you wish to test (S1 or S2)
000025    2: On one machine, open the server directory in a terminal window and type make to compile the server program (server.cpp)
000026    3: On another machine (or machines, if S2), open the client directory
000027    4: Open the client.cpp program in your favourite IDE/text-editor. You will need to enter the name of the host which is running the server into the constructor of the client_socket object. Save and close.
000028    5: In the terminal on the client machine, type make to compile the client program
000029    6: Watch as this document is displayed on the terminal, in the correct order, and with no missing line :)
000030    7: The client program will exit after it receives the whole data file from the server
000031          s
000032 END OF FILE
